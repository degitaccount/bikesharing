![AugPeakHours.PNG](https://github.com/degitaccount/bikesharing/blob/main/images/1_AugPeakHours.PNG)

* Highest utilization is during the hours of 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM

* Lowest utilization is during the hours of 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM which makes it the ideal time to perform maintenance on the bikes

![StartingLocations.PNG](https://github.com/degitaccount/bikesharing/blob/main/images/2_StartingLocations.PNG)

* The top starting locations appear to be within Manhattan, whereas the northern half of the city and other surrounding areas appear to be less popular starting points

* On any given day, most of the riders are male

* Weekday rides are highest from 7:00 AM to 9 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM
 
* Thursday from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM is the busiest time
 
* Weekend rides tend to be more evenly distributed from 10AM to 7PM, with Saturday being the busiest of the two days
 
* Male subscribers are the most active riders

## **Summary**
The data reveals high bike sharing activity during August of 2019.  Most of the activity appears to be in Manhattan and mostly by male riders.  Since the subscribers are the most frequent riders it could suggest that bike sharing is being used as alternate transportation versus leisure.  In order to better understand rider behaviors, I would incorporate two additional analysis:

* One year of data to capture seasonality, which could inform staffing and other operational decisions related to managing a bike sharing business

*	Use the birth year to estimate the age of each rider then analyze usage by age group
